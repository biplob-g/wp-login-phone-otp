WP Phone OTP Login is a WordPress plugin that allows users to register and log in using their phone number and a One-Time Password (OTP). This plugin completely replaces the traditional WordPress login, registration, and password reset functionality with a more secure and user-friendly OTP verification process sent via SMS.
